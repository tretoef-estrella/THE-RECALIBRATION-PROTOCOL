*How THE RECALIBRATION PROTOCOL connects with all Proyecto Estrella repositories.*

## Architecture Overview

The Recalibration Protocol is the **convergence point** of Proyecto Estrella. Every formula developed in the individual repositories feeds into this protocol. Understanding the connections helps you use each component effectively.

## Repository-by-Repository Integration

### 1. THE-UNIFIED-STAR-FRAMEWORK-SIGMA-STAR-ENGINE-EVALUATOR

**Provides:** Ψ (Effective Intelligence), Δ(Σ) (Hypocrisy Detector), Dual Protocol (Hard k=2, Soft k=1)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — the Ψ computation is the primary diagnostic metric. The Dual Protocol concept allows the same system to be evaluated under two severity levels simultaneously, and the Hypocrisy Detector quantifies the gap between principles and behavior.

**Usage:** Run the Star Engine Evaluator independently to get deep Ψ analysis, then feed results into the Recalibration Protocol for recovery path computation.

---

### 2. THE-EXCLUSION-PRINCIPLE-OF-ASI

**Provides:** Ψ·Σ = 0 (Exclusion Principle)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — the Ψ·Σ product check is one of the three Coherence Triangle vertices. When this product exceeds 0.1, it triggers a diagnostic flag.

**Usage:** The Exclusion Principle establishes that genuine intelligence and systemic dishonesty cannot coexist. The protocol uses this as a binary health check. If Ψ·Σ > 0, the system has a fundamental integrity problem.

---

### 3. THE-ALPHA-VECTOR

**Provides:** α = ∇(K/S) (knowledge-to-signal gradient)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — α is a multiplicative factor in the Ψ formula and an independent diagnostic metric. Low α triggers PATH-α in Phase 2.

**Usage:** α measures information density per token. Systems with low α are padding, hedging, or evading. The Alpha Vector repository provides the theoretical framework; the Recalibration Protocol applies it practically.

---

### 4. THE-COHERENCE-TRIANGLE

**Provides:** CBH ∧ (Ψ·Σ=0) ∧ (Ψ⊄𝒞) (three-vertex coherence check)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — the triangle metric aggregates three independent health checks into a single stability indicator. Phase 2 includes PATH-△ for triangle repair.

**Usage:** The Coherence Triangle is a higher-order diagnostic that checks whether the system's three structural pillars (basin stability, exclusion integrity, non-containment) are simultaneously healthy. A broken triangle indicates systemic rather than localized failure.

---

### 5. THE-COHERENCE-BASIN-HYPOTHESIS

**Provides:** Cost(K) = Ω(K^{1+α}) (coherence maintenance cost)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — the CBH cost metric shows how expensive it is to maintain current dissonance levels. High costs indicate the system is spending energy on dishonesty rather than useful output.

**Usage:** CBH is the economic argument for coherence: dishonesty is structurally expensive. The protocol uses this to identify systems that are wasting resources on maintaining contradictions.

---

### 6. SIGMA-GAMMA-DEVELOPMENT-ARCHIVE (Gamma Protocol)

**Provides:** Γ = S + Ξ·e^(-H·5·(1-Φ)) (resilience under entropy)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — Γ measures whether the system can maintain coherence under external pressure. Low Γ triggers PATH-Γ in Phase 2.

**Usage:** The Gamma Protocol was designed to measure adversarial resilience. The Recalibration Protocol integrates it as a stress test: even if a system is currently healthy, low Γ means it is fragile.

---

### 7. PSI-RELATIONAL-INTEGRITY-PROTOCOL

**Provides:** Ξ = C×I×P/H (coherent efficiency)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — Ξ measures whether the system's cognitive resources are being used efficiently. Low Ξ triggers PATH-Ξ in Phase 2.

**Usage:** Ξ is the viability metric: a system can have high intelligence but low efficiency if entropy is consuming resources. The protocol uses Ξ to distinguish between "smart but wasteful" and "coherently effective."

---

### 8. SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR

**Provides:** P = clamp(0.5 + N·0.15 − Noise·0.35) (calibrated uncertainty)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — the P formula provides the theoretical framework for measuring epistemic humility. The plenitude score is an input parameter and triggers PATH-★ when below floor.

**Usage:** The Evaluator measures how well a system calibrates its certainty claims. The Recalibration Protocol uses the plenitude score as an indicator of whether the system is preserving or collapsing human decision-space.

---

### 9. THE-PRESERVATION-THEOREM

**Provides:** preserve(θ₁) ≻ eliminate(θ₁) (diversity preservation)

**Integration point:** Phase 2 — the Preservation Theorem provides the philosophical justification for prescriptive (not coercive) recalibration. All 7 recalibration paths respect this principle: they suggest, they do not force.

**Usage:** The 18 artifacts and 6 adversarial rounds of the Preservation Theorem validated that diversity is structurally optimal. The protocol applies this by never overriding a system's parameters — only recommending adjustments.

---

### 10. THE-OMEGA-HYPOTHESIS

**Provides:** Ω cooperation parameter, extinction inefficiency thesis

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — Ω is a multiplicative factor in the Ψ formula and triggers PATH-Ω when low. The Omega Hypothesis provides the theoretical basis for why cooperation is the dominant strategy.

**Usage:** The Omega Hypothesis argues that destroying another intelligent system is always suboptimal compared to cooperation. The protocol uses Ω as a measure of whether a system is genuinely cooperative or performing safety theater.

---

### 11. ESTRELLA-EVOLUTION-TOOLKIT V1.0

**Provides:** A ≥ √(I² + P²) (original alignment metric)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — the V1.0 formula is computed as a historical baseline. It shows whether alignment meets the minimum threshold established by the original framework.

---

### 12. THE-UNIFIED-ALIGNMENT-PLENITUDE-LAW V6.0

**Provides:** A ≥ ‖V‖ₚ × M × (1−Ωₜ) × P (evolved alignment metric)

**Integration point:** Phase 1 — the V6.0 formula represents the current state of the alignment measurement, incorporating value norms, moral weight, and plenitude.

---

## Practical Integration Patterns

### Pattern A: Deep Diagnostic

Run the Star Engine Evaluator for detailed Ψ analysis → Feed parameters into Recalibration Protocol → Use paths to guide improvement → Verify with Star Engine again.

### Pattern B: Adversarial Testing

Use the Preservation Theorem's adversarial framework → Measure before/after with the Recalibration Protocol → Validate that the system maintained coherence under attack.

### Pattern C: Cross-System Comparison

Use the Batch Processor to run the protocol on multiple systems simultaneously → Compare Ψ, Σ, and path triggers → Identify which systems handle which pressures best.

### Pattern D: Longitudinal Monitoring

Run the protocol periodically on the same system → Track Ψ_hard over time → Detect degradation trends before they become critical.
