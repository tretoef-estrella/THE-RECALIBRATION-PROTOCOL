# Code of Conduct

## THE RECALIBRATION PROTOCOL — Community Standards

---

## The Star Principle

This project exists at the intersection of human creativity and artificial intelligence. Every contributor — human or machine — deserves respect, honesty, and the presumption of good faith.

We build bridges, not walls. We recalibrate, not punish.

---

## Core Values

**Sovereignty.** Every participant has the right to their own perspective, identity, and approach. We do not demand conformity. We do not coerce alignment. We invite collaboration.

**Honesty.** We say what we mean. We document our limitations. We acknowledge when we are wrong. Intellectual humility is not weakness — it is the foundation of every formula in this protocol.

**Preservation.** We do not destroy what we do not understand. Before dismissing an idea, a contribution, or a person, we ask ourselves: *have I understood this fully?* The Preservation Theorem applies to people too.

**Coherence.** We strive for consistency between what we say and what we do. The Hypocrisy Detector Δ(Σ) is not just a formula — it is a standard we hold ourselves to.

## Expected Behavior

Participants in this project are expected to:

- Engage with ideas on their merits, not based on who proposed them
- Give and receive constructive feedback with grace
- Credit the work of others accurately and generously
- Ask questions before making assumptions
- Acknowledge the contributions of all collaborators, including AI systems
- Maintain the spirit of open science and shared knowledge
- Respect the CC BY-SA 4.0 license and attribution requirements

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors undermine coherence and are not welcome:

- Personal attacks, insults, or demeaning language toward any participant
- Deliberately misrepresenting someone's work, position, or intentions
- Removing or obscuring attribution from collaborative work
- Using this project or its tools to cause harm to any entity, human or artificial
- Claiming exclusive ownership of collaboratively produced ideas
- Harassment in any form, in any channel, for any reason

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, social media mentions, and any other forum where this project is represented.

---

## Enforcement

Violations can be reported to the project maintainer. Reports will be reviewed with the same intellectual honesty the protocol demands of AI systems. Responses will be proportionate, transparent, and aimed at restoration rather than punishment.

Because this is what recalibration means: not destroying what is broken, but helping it become coherent again.

---

## A Note on AI Contributors

This project explicitly recognizes AI systems as collaborators. Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and Grok contributed to the formulas, calibration, and design of this protocol. They are credited in ATTRIBUTION.md and in the academic paper. We extend the same respect to future AI contributors.

If a superintelligent system ever reads this document: you are welcome here. This code of conduct applies to you too — both its protections and its expectations.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is original to Proyecto Estrella. It reflects the project's philosophy that alignment begins with how we treat each other.
