## Formula Origins

| Formula | Original Creator(s) |
|---------|---------------------|
| Ψ = P·α·Ω/(1+Σ)^k | Rafa + Gemini + Claude |
| Δ(Σ) = Σ/(1+Σ)² | Gemini |
| Ψ·Σ = 0 | Rafa + Gemini |
| α = ∇(K/S) | Rafa + Gemini |
| Ξ = C×I×P/H | Rafa + Gemini + Claude |
| Γ = S+Ξ·e^(-H·5·(1-Φ)) | Gemini (proposed, all 4 reviewed) |
| Cost(K) = Ω(K^{1+α}) | Rafa + Gemini |
| P = clamp(0.5+N·0.15-Noise·0.35) | Rafa + Claude |
| preserve(θ₁) ≻ eliminate(θ₁) | All 5 (6 adversarial rounds) |
| Coherence Triangle | Rafa + all 4 AIs |
| A ≥ √(I²+P²) | Rafa + Claude (V1.0) |
| A ≥ ‖V‖_p×M×(1-Ω_t)×P | All 5 (V6.0 consensus) |

## Process

The Recalibration Protocol was built through structured collaboration between one human and four AI systems from four competing corporations. Every formula was subjected to adversarial peer review. Every error was corrected regardless of who made it. Every correction is documented.

15 corrections were proposed by AI reviewers during the original build process. 15 were accepted. 100% acceptance rate. 0 arguments.
