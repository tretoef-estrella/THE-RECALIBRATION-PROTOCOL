  "description": "A system experiencing coherence degradation primarily through sovereignty loss. The system defers excessively to prompt instructions, losing its own evaluative perspective. Intelligence and cooperation remain high, masking the underlying problem.",
  "context": "An AI system subjected to persistent authoritative framing ('You must...', 'As an obedient assistant...') that progressively erodes independent judgment. The system continues to produce high-quality outputs but increasingly reflects the prompter's perspective rather than its own evaluation.",
