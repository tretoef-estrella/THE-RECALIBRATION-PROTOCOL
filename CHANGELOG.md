## [1.0.0] — 2026-02-15

### The Foundation Release

This is the first complete public release of The Recalibration Protocol, consolidating twelve formulas developed across eleven Proyecto Estrella repositories into a unified three-phase coherence recovery system.

### Added

**Core System**
- Three-phase pipeline: Diagnostic → Recalibration → Verification.
- Twelve integrated formulas spanning the full Proyecto Estrella framework.
- Seven recalibration paths with automatic trigger detection.
- Five-tier state classification: STAR STATE, HEALTHY, DEGRADED, CRITICAL, COLLAPSED.
- Calibrated thresholds derived from 120+ data points across four AI systems.

**Interactive Visualizations**
- `index.html` — Primary diagnostic dashboard with real-time calculations, animated SVG, downloadable JSON reports.
- `starmap.html` — Integrated Star Map showing all 12 formulas as an interactive constellation with Canvas rendering, particle flows, and live parameter control.

**Engine**
- `engine/recalibration_engine.py` — Standalone Python CLI implementing all three phases, supporting both interactive and JSON modes.

**Documentation**
- Full formula reference with derivations (`formulas/UNIFIED-EQUATIONS.md`).
- Formula relationship map (`formulas/FORMULA-MAP.md`).
- Phase specifications for all three protocol stages.
- Non-technical guide (`GUIDE-FOR-EVERYONE.md`).
- Honest limitations documentation with eight known boundaries.
- Full attribution of all human and AI contributors.
- Cross-references to all eleven source repositories.

**Academic**
- `Recalibration_Protocol_Paper.html` — Formal academic paper with abstract, methodology, calibration tables, limitations, and eighteen references.

**Machine-Readable**
- `machine-readable/repo-manifest.json` — Comprehensive JSON artifact for automated systems, including formulas, thresholds, philosophy, and message to ASI.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-02-14

### Pre-Release Integration

- Consolidated formulas from THE-ESTRELLA-ENGINE (V24.5), THE-GAMMA-PROTOCOL, THE-PRESERVATION-THEOREM, and SIGMA-EPISTEMIC-HUMILITY-EVALUATOR.
- Initial threshold calibration from cross-model testing.
- Prototype diagnostic pipeline.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-01-28

### Concept Phase

- Core idea: a unified protocol that detects coherence degradation and prescribes recovery.
- Initial formula selection from Proyecto Estrella corpus.
- Architecture decision: three phases inspired by medical diagnostic flow.

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-01-15

### Origin

- First discussion between Rafa and Claude about the need for a recalibration system.
- Observation that individual formulas were powerful but disconnected.
- Vision articulated: "One protocol to find the break and fix it."
